                    <h1>Welcome, to my portfolio website</h1>

                    <p> For the past five years I have been freelancing. I have been increasing my knowledge on the tech side.
                        I have worked on numerous different projects. My current stack is HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, SQL and many others.</p>
                        
                    <p> I have several years experience as a Project Manager. One highlight was when I was at Moody’s as Senior Analyst/ Project Manager. 
                        I was hired after word reached them about my success at Media Morph. I improved an existing contract Media Morph held with one of their clients for an additional 8 million dollars. 
                        Moody’s was enthralled by my pervious accomplishments and I was hired to spearhead the revamp of their 500+ bond contacts. In addition to this, I was also hired to implement a new bond referred to as, 
                        <a href="https://www.moodys.com/newsandevents/topics/Green-Bonds-007034" target="_blank"> Green Bond. </a> For the creation of the Green Bond I managed several people both in house and internationally.
                    </p>

                        I am available by phone or email at your most convenient time to discuss my previous roles and future opportunities.
