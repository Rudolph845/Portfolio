                    <h1>Welcome, to my portfolio website</h1>

                    <p>My last role was at Moody’s as Senior Analyst/ Project Manager. 
                        I was hired after word reached them about my success at Mediamorph. 
                        I improved an existing contract Mediamorph held with one of their clients for an additional 8 million dollars.</p>
                    <p>Moody’s was enthralled by my pervious accomplishments and I was hired to spearhead the revamp of their 500+ bond contacts. 
                        In addition to this, I was also hired to implement a new bond referred to as, <a href="https://www.moodys.com/newsandevents/topics/Green-Bonds-007034." target="_blank"> Green Bond. </a> 
                        For the creation of the Green Bond I managed several people both in house and internationally.</p>
